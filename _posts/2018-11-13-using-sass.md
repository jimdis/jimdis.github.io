So, this is the first time I've tried using a CSS preprocessor, in this case [Sass](https://sass-lang.com). Compared to good ol' plain CSS, it takes some getting used to, but one thing I immediately liked was defining some base variables for font-family and colors. I created a site using just html and css for a previous course and my basic idea was copying the overall feel of that site and modifying the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) template accordingly. I have to say it was much quicker than I thought once I figured out how [everything works](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/)... I first started out modifying the partials in the _sass directory, but then I realized it was smarter to follow the instructions in the minima template [readme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/README.md) and just add my custom scss to the main.scss file to override the default css. This keeps everything in one place and makes sure that I can easily keep my preferred site design while still being able to use future versions of minima.

You can download my modified [main.scss here](/files/main.scss).I started out modifying minima.css by changing the `$brand-color` to my color of choice. I also changed the `$background-color` and `$text-color`. The fonts needed some change too, so I changed the `$base-font-family` and added a `$heading-font-family` to separate the style of headings from other text.
