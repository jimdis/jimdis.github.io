The [Open Graph Protocol](http://ogp.me) was invented by Facebook to enable developers to integrate their pages into Facebook's [Social Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph) and since then it's become a standard for "rich" links that display more than just a link. In our course we use Slack, and when pasting links from pages that support Open Graph into slack, you don't just get the url - you see the page title, an image, a snippet of content etc. The benefit to the user is that I instantly know if the link is relevant without having to click it. The benefit to the developer/publisher is that it probably draws more clicks than a simple URL if the content looks interesting.

On this site, I simply followed the steps in this [blog post](http://davidensinger.com/2013/04/adding-open-graph-tags-to-jekyll/) by pasting the code into my head.html, and creating a [high-resolution logo](http://localhost:4000/assets/img/logo-high-resolution.png) of this site's favicon and putting it in its proper place (using the recommendations in [this post](https://www.h3xed.com/web-and-internet/how-to-use-og-image-meta-tag-facebook-reddit).
