Since there's no way to prevent "bad" robots from entering your website, and since information wants to be free, I chose not to disallow anything. I also found some SEO tips for Jekyll blogs on Github pages on [a blog](http://vdaubry.github.io/2014/10/21/SEO-for-your-Jekyll-blog/), where I implemented the part about a sitemap and robots.txt (which required a Jekyll gem for generating the sitemap when the site is run locally). So my [robots.txt](/robots.txt) has the [sitemap](/sitemap.xml) path specified in it.
