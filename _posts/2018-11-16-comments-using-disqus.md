Implementing Disqus on this site was probably the easiest part so far.. I simply created a [Disqus](https://disqus.com) account and created a site in the admin panel. Then I just followed the instructions in the [Minima Readme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima#enabling-comments-via-disqus) and modified `_config.yml` by including the lines:

    disqus:
      shortname: my_disqus_shortname

Done!
