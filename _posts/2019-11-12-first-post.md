Hello world!

Just testing out Jekyll and markdown for the first time. Feels good!

Testing a first level header
==============================
Some text..

Testing a second level header
-----------------------------
Some more text..

### Header 3 with a nice quote

Still with me? Here is some *emphasis* for you and a quote:

> If you live according to nature, you will never be poor; 
> if you live according to opinion, you will never be rich.
> -Epicurus

### Testing out lists

Things I'm seeing right now:
- A macbook pro screen
- A cup of coffee
- "RÃ¥dhuset" outside the window

Top three rap albums with links:
1. The Chronic [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronic)
2. Enter the Wu Tang (36 chambers) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_the_Wu-Tang_(36_Chambers))
3. The Infamous [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infamous)

That's it for now.

Peace!
