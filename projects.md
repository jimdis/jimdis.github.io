Here you'll find my portfolio of projects, both as part of my education and personal projects.

## insiderhandel.nu

A web app for searching, filtering and sharing information about trades reported by company insiders on Swedish stock exchanges. The project was built using React with Redux on the client and Node/Express/MongoDB as a backend.

## Retro Desktop

[![Retro Desktop application](/assets/img/retro-desktop.png)](https://jimdis.github.io/retro-desktop/)
A Windows 3.1 inspired SPA where you can open and move around multiple windows. Currently contains a game of Memory with a 90s PC games theme and a game of "21" (sort of like Black Jack). All written in Vanilla JS client-side, no frameworks or libraries used.
