Hello!

This site was created for the course ["Client-based web programming"](https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/klientbaserad-webbprogrammering/) at Linnaeus university. It contains a [little introduction](/about/) to myself, some [blog posts](/blog/) about creating the site and a page with some of my [music](/music/).

The site was created locally using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a nice static site generator that I'm just starting to get the hang of, and then published to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). All the posts on this site were written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which I really enjoyed learning and using.

Anyhow, enjoy!
