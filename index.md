Hello!

![Ducks in Stockholm](/assets/img/ducks.jpg)This site was created for the course ["Client-based web programming"](https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/klientbaserad-webbprogrammering/) at Linnaeus university. It contains a [little introduction](/about/) to myself and some [blog posts](/blog/) about creating the site.

The site was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a nice static site generator that I'm just starting to get the hang of. I'll probably add some more stuff here soon, like a page with my music. All the posts and most pages on this site were written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which I really enjoyed using. 

Anyhow, enjoy!
