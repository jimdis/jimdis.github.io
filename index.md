Welcome!

This site was originally created for the course ["Client-based web programming"](https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/klientbaserad-webbprogrammering/) at Linnaeus university. It contains a [little introduction](/about/) to myself, some [blog posts](/blog/) about creating the site and a page with some of my [music](/music/). But I also try to maintain the site as a portfolio site with [my projects](/projects).

The site was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and then published to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). All the posts on this site were written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Enjoy!
