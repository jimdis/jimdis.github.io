Here you'll find my portfolio of projects, both as part of my education and personal projects.

## Retro Desktop

[![Retro Desktop application](/assets/img/retro-desktop.png)](https://jimdis.github.io/retro-desktop/)
A Windows 3.1 inspired SPA where you can open and move around multiple windows. Currently contains a game of Memory with a 90s PC games theme and a game of "21" (sort of like Black Jack). All written in Vanilla JS client-side, no frameworks or libraries used.
