All I Get,2013,Ableton Live,91150902,solo,,What started out as an effort to produce a swingin' 808 beat ended up as some sort of trance/hiphop fusion.
The New Phenom,2013,Ableton Live,530897511,solo,,"Rap hooks, vocoders, syntesizers and a funky beat - what more could you want? Produced in Ableton Live in 2013."
The Phaserchase,2010,Reason,530904324,solo,,"Sort of in between the demoscene sound of the 90s and the classic ""Orange Theme"" remix, this was the last track I made in Reason in 2010."
"""Softa Trummor"" (unreleased)",2004,Reason,530970786,collab,Ludvig,"Produced in Reason in 2004, I put down the basic track and my buddy Ludvig improved it greatly. It was supposed to have vocals and was never released anywhere, but I still dig the hook at 2:25!"
"""jimpaluddejobba3"" (unreleased)",2002,Reason,530973465,collab,Ludvig,"An untitled and unreleased collab between myself and my buddy Ludvig, I think this track was supposed to compete at Remedy 2002 or 2003, but I guess it never did for some reason. Anyway, it was made in Reason in 2002."
Sparrows,2001,Reason,530898897,solo,,"Inspired by Airwave and the typical ""Superstring"" sound of the times, this track was produced in Reason in 2001."
"""Oklar""",2000,FastTracker 2,530993229,collab,Navid,"Probably the best of the Navid/Jim collabs, this poor track never got a proper name since it was deemed ""unfinished"". It was inspired by the Armin van Buuren remix of Vincent de Moor's ""Shamu"" and was made in FastTracker 2 in 2000 and edited for some light mastering in CoolEdit Pro."
"A Different Time, A Different Place ",2000,FastTracker 2,530988525,collab,Navid,"Another collaboration between the melody master Navid and me, this song was produced in FastTracker 2 in 2000, with some Rebirth basslines."
Control the Sun,1999,FastTracker 2,530987907,collab,Navid,"Collaboration between my buddy Navid and me, Navid was the expert on catchy hooks and I liked the craft of putting it all together. Made in FastTracker 2 in 1999."
Art of Living,1999,FastTracker 2,530985840,collab,Ludvig,"Made by Spiritual Activity, Solna's most 1337 group in 1999 ;). I think the Rebirth 303 bassline was the best part of this track made by my buddy Ludvig and me in FastTracker 2."
Summer Feelings,1999,FastTracker 2,530978595,collab,Ludvig,"The late 90s were Happy Hardcore times with Charlie Lownoise and Menthal Theo blasting in my headphones. Me and my buddy Ludvig had our group ""Spiritual Activity"" and this was our Happy Hardcore Anthem ""Summer Feelings"", produced in FastTracker 2 in 1998 I think and then edited in Cool Edit Pro in 1999!"
Rave Raiser,1997,FastTracker 2,529183527,solo,,"Inspired by the rave sound of the 90s tracking scene (Dutch group <a href=""https://www.explizit.org"">Explizit</a> was a big source of inspiration), this song blew away the competition in our little local music compo ""Plastic"". Today it sounds like crap, but at the time it was a hit!"
