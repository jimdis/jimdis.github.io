Hello there!

I'm Jim Disenstam, a 36 year old father and wannabe programmer, living in Kungsholmen, Stockholm with my wife Hanna and our two children; Alice: 4 and John: 1.

After getting a degree in economics/finance from HandelshÃ¶gskolan in Stockholm in 2005, I spent 13 years working in financial advisory and corporate banking, but always feeling at my best in front of Excel rather than doing deals. Producing financial models and writing deeply nested if-statements is when I experienced the flow I used to feel when producing music in FastTracker 2 as a teen in the 90s.

While finance kept getting more and more regulated and less and less creative, a nagging voice kept telling me "you should have studied computer science instead of finance, you sell-out", so having saved up some money and and built up a pretty solid portfolio of stocks, I finally felt it was time for a change.

## Where to go from here?

So here we are. I'm off to a good start, having finalized the first elementary course in Javascript and feeling that programming is everything I had hoped for and more. I get the same kind of flow experience I used to feel making music and trying to figure out how to make something sound just right within the technical constraints of the tracker. Time flies and the brain gets properly exercised.

I'm still very unsure of what to do with my life once I finish the [Web Programmer](https://coursepress.lnu.se/program/webbprogrammerare/) program I'm currently enrolled in. Maybe working as a programmer for a company is the way to learn the tools of the trade properly and get the social stimulus of working with good people around you? Or maybe I'll come up with some ideas of my own that could lead to commercial products? Who knows, right now I'm happy where I am. With two little kids life is plenty busy anyway, so having the freedom to study and code any time and any place is incredibly valuable.

## Other interests

Why not make this page a bit more personal? Since one of my personality traits (I'm an [INTJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTJ)) is introversion, I usually don't like to talk about myself. But as a general goal in life, I try to be more outgoing and open, so here goes...

### Self-improvement

> The greater danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it.
>
> -Michelangelo

Always reading something that will hopefully make me wiser (currently "Sapiens"), always having some sort of health or happiness-related project going on (currently brewing Kombucha), always looking at TED talks or YouTube clips about some topic of interest (currently retro gaming consoles), and reading blogs about self improvement, health, training etc (a couple of favorites: [Raptitude](https://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/) and [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com), or [Leangains](https://leangains.com) for all your training and diet needs!)

### Investing

> Price is what you pay, value is what you get.
>
> -Warren Buffett

I'm a value investor at heart, having read the classic ["The intelligent investor"](https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661) just before the financial crisis broke out in 2008 and then discovering all sorts of great books and role models in Investing. Some of my role models:

- Benjamin Graham
- Warren Buffett
- Philip Fisher
- Peter Lynch
- Joel Greenblatt
- Howard Marks
- Edgar Wachenheim III
- Guy Spier
- Mohnish Pabrai

I spend several hour per week reading up on companies and their industries through their annual & quarterly reports, analyst reports, investing blogs, Twitter, etc. I don't trade much, but I keep a close watch on my portfolio companies' fundamental performance.

### Training

Growing up a skinny kid and then a skinny-fat teen sucking at sports, learning to lift weights in my late teens and managing to put on some modest muscle mass really gave me a confidence boost and changed my outlook on life. From seeing sports and training as something inherently negative that you just have to do, to embracing training as a way to set short-term and long-term goals, get feedback, make adjustments, instill discipline and learn patience.

### Misc

Other stuff I try to find the time to do:

- PC Gaming (currently playing a lot of Overwatch, but my favorite games are first person RPGs like the Elder Scrolls series and the Fallout series.) When I was younger I spent countless hours in classic adventure games like Monkey Island and Simon the Sorcerer, and also simulators like Transport Tycoon and Sim City.
- Music production. Currently pretty inactive since it takes too much time, but my DAW of choice is [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) together with the Push hardware. Before that it was [Reason](https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason) (2001-2012) and before that [FastTracker 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastTracker_2) (1996-2001). I have a ton of unfinished tracks but I plan to publish a bunch of my finished ones on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jim-disenstam). If you browse old "demoscene" archives you can find my early tracker music under my scene handle ["Polemic"](https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=147988).
