Hello there!

I'm Jim Disenstam, a 38 year old father, programmer, hobbyist music producer and finance nerd living in Kungsholmen, Stockholm with my wife Hanna and our two children; Alice: 5 and John: 2.

After getting a degree in economics/finance from Handelshögskolan in Stockholm in 2005, I spent 13 years working in financial advisory and corporate banking, but always feeling at my best trying to solve difficult problems in front of a computer screen rather than negotiating loan documentation.

While finance kept getting more and more regulated and less and less creative, a nagging voice kept telling me "you should have studied computer science instead of finance, you sell-out", so having saved up some money and built up a pretty solid portfolio of stocks, I finally felt it was time for a change and, at a ripe old age of 36, signed up for two years of university studies at Linnéuniversitetet's [Web Programmer](https://lnu.se/program/webbprogrammerare) .

This site was originally created for an early course in Web Development, but I keep it around for fun and try to update it when the need arises. Meanwhile, check out my [music](/music) and [my projects](/projects)!
